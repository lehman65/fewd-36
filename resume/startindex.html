			<h3>A Little About Me</h3>

		<div class= "row">

		<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">

			  	<p class="lead">
			  	 I come from a customer service background, mostly in retail management, but recently with a tech start up here in San Francisco.  I love working with clients to bring them optimum value and service, and providing a bridge of understanding and mutual benefit to users and developers.
			     <br />
			     <br />
			     I hope that becoming proficient in front-end web development will provide me with a skill set that maximizes my productivity and creativity in any business or entrepreneurial environment I may explore.

			    <p>
			      I am originally from Dallas, Tx., having re-located to the Bay Area in 2014.  I wanted to be closer to my sister and her two children, and was given that opportunity when I accepted a position at ThreadSuite LLC, a SaaS Provider in the Apparel space.  It was a leap of faith, but one I don't regret in the slightest!  I learned so much about how to best provide product features and services to users, while learning how to do QA and product/feature development, and becoming familiar with the business rules and culture.
			      <br />
			      <br />
			      I enjoy being with my family and friends, enjoying life in the Bay Area and spending time in the great Western outdoors hiking, camping, pursuing water sports or just communing with nature.
